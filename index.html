    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I was born and raised in Framingham, Massachusetts.<br>
    I grew up with 3 siblings, and another one later on.<br>
    Rabbits have always been our family pets, we breed and<br>
    raise them. I've played soccer since as long as I remember,<br>
    and started gymnastics in 3rd grade (I later dropped it<br>
    at Level 8 in 6th grade). I picked up playing the Piano<br>
    in 7th grade, and have been playing it ever since.</p>
